Ok, I'm just joking about that.  `Javascript` will never die.  Its too late to kill it, but there are some alternatives for programming the front-end.  Lets take a look at the following languages and see their strengths (maybe some weaknesses), and compare them with `Javascript`.

* [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/)
* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
* [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)
* [Fable](http://fable.io/)
* [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/)

In future posts, I'll work on an example related to the counting example that I posted earlier with [Preact/MobX](http://typeerror.net/2017/09/12/preact-mobx/) posts.

Also there are probably a few more alternatives, but I feel these are some of more popular ones.  
I must admit, I do have a little bias.  I did spend some learning `Elm` a couple years ago and I really liked it.  I know the language has changed a little bit in recent versions and look forward to taking a look at the latest.
So the next post I'll start with `ClojureSript`!
