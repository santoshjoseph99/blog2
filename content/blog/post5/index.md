I needed to replace the spaces in a string and instead of copying into my editor I put the string into my F# Interactive window….
```
> “a b c d e”.Replace(” “,”“);;
val it : string = “abcde”
```
Then I thought it should work in the Package Manger Console:
```
PM> “a b c d e”.Replace(” “, “”)
abcde
```
And yes you can do that in the powershell as well and you can try the Python interactive window (and I’m sure the list can go on).

I keep forgetting how much power/flexibility there is with just the interactive shells that come with VS.
