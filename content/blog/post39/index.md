## HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Since there is a whole lot more then text happening
in a HTML document, it should be called Text And Media Markup Language which would be TAMML or TAML, but
thats not going to happen. Anyways, the acronym doesn't have to mean exactly what it stands for. The main
thing to understand that HTML has some underpinning of being a _text document_ that can _link_ to other documents. The
importance of links cannot be under estimated (without those links [Google](https://www.google.com) wouldn't even exist!).

A word of semantic HTML. I think its important to structure your document with the correct tags corresponding to your content. This is also important for accessibility, so keep that in mind.

So, this article will quickly cover some of the major tags and not so major tags in the HTML world. And hopefully give some interesting examples...

## The Usual (Suspects)

- `<html>` - the root element
- `<head>` - some important things here
- `<body>` - a bit more important things here
- `<a>` - the Hyper in HTML
- `<main>`
- `<article>`
- `<aside>`
- `<figcaption>`
- `<figure>`
- `<pre>`
- `<iframe>`

## The Rare

- `<sub>`
- `<del> & <ins>`
- `<progress>`
- `<details> & <summary>`

## The Ugly

- `<blink>`
- `<acronym>`

## Exercises/Questions

- Write an HTML web crawler that visits a few predetermined sites or maybe goes very limited in depth and keep a count of the HTML tags. You can see the frequency and get a good idea of what tags are really used.
