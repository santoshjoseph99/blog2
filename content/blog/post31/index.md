This could be fun, and most likely interesting. My goal
is to consistently write and see what happens. I really want
to write a few topics about:

- Learning about Android Programming
- How to succeed at a big company
- Algorithms in Kotlin
- Software Quality
- Tutorials using the card game "Go"
- Design patterns
- Bitcoin programming

When I said, I want to "see what happens"...I'm not sure what that actually means. I should spend some time and define
my results or expectations...
maybe it means

- Someone learns something useful.
- I learn better by writing.
- I articulate my thoughts better.
- Build my "brand".
- Precursor to a youtube coding channel

Anyways, it will really depend on the quality and consistently of the content. I hope to have the time, because it will be tough with a demanding new job!
