So last night about 11:30pm PST, as I lie awake trying to get to sleep for the last 45 minutes (I don't get to sleep too easily), I heard a sound.  It was almost like a piece of wood hitting against another wood...kind of a knock but maybe more like wood against metal.  (I heard this noise before many times, but at this time of night I couldn't place it correctly).  

Anyways, the heart starts to pump more blood and I open my eyes hoping the noise would stop.  It didn't.  Then I think its the cat.  He is kind annoying at times and since cats are nocturnal, he might be up and around just causing his usual trouble.  It wasn't the cat, since he was at the foot of the bed.

Then I thought, it could be the dog but no, I would have heard her get up (plus she is heavily sedated...another story).  Her toe nails clicking on the hardwood floor could almost wake me up out of a deep sleep.  So I got up and started to walk to the front of the house.  I forgot my weapon of choice which was nicely stored on the end table next my side of the bed.

I get down the hallway and pause when I reach a fork where going right would get me into the living room and front door where this suspected break in was happening or going left which would take into the third bedroom which is converted basically into my home office. I hear the noise coming clearly from the office and I think, is there someone trying to open the window with a tool and just being really clumsy at it?

I walk into the office and I notice right away the noise is not coming from the window, but the printer.  Its printing something (and its really loud especially when the rest of the house is quite).  I think right away someone has hacked the printer and printing paper for no reason.  So I go over and take out the first piece of paper.  It has in big bold font at the top of the page:

#### Your Printer Update Has Been Completed

I'm like what?  That has never happened before.  Its an HP 2600 series printer and its great the printer can take care of itself but why does it need to this update in the middle of the night and also why bother tell me about it?

Thanks HP.
